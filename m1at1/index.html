  <h2>Towards a zero electricity bill</h2>
  <hr>
    <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat
        pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a
        system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>
  
     

  <h2>Solar PV Solutions</h2>
  <hr>
  
  <img src="images/pv250.jpg" alt="roof with the solar pannel">
  <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee
    reliable cost-free power to your home or business. ROI is now taking less time
    than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs and better technology.
    <br><br>
    If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion
    chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further.
    <br><br>
    Call us now to discuss which solution is the best fit for your home.</p>
    


  <h2>Geothermal</h2>
  <hr>
  <img src="images/geo250.jpg" alt="geothermal power plant">
  <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than
    the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution
    to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.
    <br><br>
    Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but
    has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
    boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the
    range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as
    home heating.
    <br><br>
    Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the
    earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.
    As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming
    if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>
    

  <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
  <hr>
  <img src="images/turbine250.jpg" alt="wind turbines">
  <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a
    wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a
    wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation
    potential.
    <br><br>
    New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine
    works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.
    <br><br>
    If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us,
    contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.</p>
